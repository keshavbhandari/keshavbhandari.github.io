Welcome! I am a graduate student at Northwestern University, IL 
pursuing my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. 
My research interests include audio signal processing, audio synthesis and 
natural language processing. I am also part of the 
[Interactive Audio Lab](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/) at Northwestern
headed by Professor Bryan Pardo.

Prior to Northwestern University, I was senior data scientist at Epsilon, India.
My work here was in the ML product engineering team and I was responsible for building and deploying
recommendation systems and predictive modeling solutions as a product for retail and FMCG clients.

When I'm not working, you can find me playing the piano, cooking or at a concert.
