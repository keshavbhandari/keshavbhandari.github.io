title: "Audioneme - Detecting Speech Disorder in Children"
excerpt: "Auditory perceptual analysis (APA) is the main method for clinical assessment of speech-language
deficits, which are one of the most prevalent childhood disabilities. However, results from APA are
susceptible to intra- and inter-rater variability. In addition, there are other limitations of manual or hand
transcription-based speech disorder diagnostic methods. To address these limitations, there is increased
interest in developing automated methods that quantify speech patterns for diagnosing speech disorders
in children. In this project, I fine-tuned Facebook's Wav2Vec2 on child speech data in conjunction with the utterance 
transcriptions to automate screening and assessment of speech disorders and speech intelligibility in children. 
The dataset for this project consisted of weakly labeled utterances comprising ~15,000 recordings of children 
with and without speech disorder.
