### [ChirpNet - A Neural Bird Sound Synthesis Model](https://keshavbhandari.github.io/portfolio/bird-sound-synthesis.html)
*Evanston, 2022* <br/>
Automated species recognition through Artificial Intelligence (AI) can provide
ecologists and wildlife conservationists the means to detect and monitor
vocalizing avian species of interest. However, AI systems rely on a multitude
of data to learn the inductive biases and to generalize to the vocalizations of
bird species. This is problematic when classifying rare bird species which
have limited presence in naturally occurring audio data. In this project, we
try to address this problem by generating synthetic avian audio samples as
a type of augmentation that can be used in future works to improve the bird
sound classification accuracy.

### [Bird Sound Denoiser](https://keshavbhandari.github.io/portfolio/bird-sound-denoiser/)
*Evanston, 2022* <br/>
In this project, I applied Facebook's Demucs - state-of-the-art audio denoiser to remove
noisy environmental background sounds from a bird sound dataset. These sounds consist of insects
such as crickets, rain, wind, machines, vehicles, etc. which were synthetically added in to a clean
set through a source separation task.

### [Audioneme - Detecting Speech Disorder in Children](https://keshavbhandari.github.io/portfolio/child-speech-disorder-detection/)
*Evanston, 2022* <br/>
There has been an increased interest in developing automated methods that quantify speech patterns for 
diagnosing speech disorders in children. In this project, I fine-tuned Facebook's Wav2Vec2 on child speech 
data in conjunction with the utterance transcriptions to automate screening and assessment of speech disorders 
and speech intelligibility in children. The dataset for this project consisted of weakly labeled 
utterances comprising ~15,000 recordings of children with and without speech disorder.

### [Efficient Scaling and Pre-Training of Language Models with Electra and Reformers](https://keshavbhandari.github.io/portfolio/electra-reformer/)
*Evanston, 2021* <br/>
In this paper, we repurpose a highly efficient Reformer encoder architecture to serve as the foundational blocks 
for the Electra pre-training methodology, thereby allowing the network to scale to 8 times the size of its transformer 
counterpart while maintaining the same memory requirements. The subsequent downstream performance of this scaled up architecture 
is at par with the transformer based Electra benchmark, while being pre-trained using only a third of the data.

### [Augmentations to improve rare bird call classification for a highly imbalanced multi-label soundscape environment](https://keshavbhandari.github.io/portfolio/bird-sound-classification-augmentations/)
*Evanston, 2021* <br/>
In this study, we present a deep learning solution to classify multiple bird vocalizations in a multi-label multi-species soundscape 
environment without a clear distinction between foreground and background species. Specifically, we focus on testing the effectiveness 
of various data augmentation methods to improve the classification of rare bird calls against some of the key challenges typical to a 
soundscape dataset - multiple overlapping bird calls, high environmental noise and high class imbalance.
