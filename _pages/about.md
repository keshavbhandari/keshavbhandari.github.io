Welcome! I am a graduate student at Northwestern University, IL. 
My research interests include audio signal processing, audio synthesis and 
natural language understanding. I am also part of the 
[Interactive Audio Lab](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/) at Northwestern
under Professor Bryan Pardo.

When I'm not working, you can find me playing the piano, cooking and at a concert.
